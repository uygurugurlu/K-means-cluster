# K-means-cluster
The manual implementation of K means cluster algorithm on iris dataset using python

-------------------------------------------

K means Cluster algorithm is implemented without the help of any external libraries. 
Elbow function implementation is added to determine optimal k value of iris dataset.

The results are 3d plotted using matplotlib
